<p>This will upgrade your Dell Axim X5 PDA to Windows Mobile 2003. It can also back up your current software version. I have not been able to find this anywhere else.</p>

<h2>HP iPAQ HX2000 Series Windows Mobile 6.5 ROM</h2>
<p>This is Spiaatie's Windows Mobile 6.5.3 ROM for the HP iPAQ HX2000 series. It works just fine on my HX2795b. This ROM is very hard to find, and I haven't been able to find it anywhere else. </p>
