<p>Bexitor (short for Basic Text Editor) is a simple, fast, lightweight, free, and open-source text editor for Windows, similar to Notepad, except with more features. It works on Windows XP and up (.net Framework 4.0 or newer is required.) I originally wrote Bexitor to learn Visual Basic, but it's turned into more of a continued project, and I would consider it "completed" currently. New versions, however, are released semi-regularly. Bexitor has .txt and .rtf support, however it can display any file as long as it's not a binary file such as .exe files. The Bexitor icons, and some of the program icons, were made by Nick Nakashima. Click the screenshot below for a full-size version. Because Microsoft hasn't heard of Bexitor yet, you may get some warning about Bexitor being unrecognized. You can ignore this, Bexitor is perfectly safe.</p>

<p>.net Framework 4.0 is required to run Bexitor, but it's included in modern Windows versions, so it's usually not neccesary to download.</p>
