I've had this IBM ThinkPad 385XD for a few years now. I paid only $30 for it from somebody who was about to take it to a recycler, but had mercifully decided to first post it on Craigslist in case anybody wanted it. It's hard to see in photos, but it's in nearly perfect condition. The only flaw on the machine is a scratch on the lid between the hinge and the status indicator lights, which I added and will regret doing for the rest of my life. I'll put more photos of it at the bottom.

Recently, I bought this big-box copy of Red Hat Linux 6.0 at Free Geek Twin Cities, a recycling center and thrift shop where I regularly volunteer here in Minneapolis. Today, Red Hat Enterprise Linux is the only operating system that still bears the Red Hat name, with Fedora being the successor to the more consumer-oriented Red Hat Linux. Red Hat Linux would continue to exist for a few years after this release, with the final version, 9, coming out in 2003. The version that I have was the first to use the GNOME 1.0 desktop environment. My copy also came with a bonus CD with plenty of additional applications. 

But first, let's get the install started. I went ahead and inserted the CD into the ThinkPad, and made sure to put the boot floppy in for good measure since I couldn't remember if the machine was capable of booting from CDs.
